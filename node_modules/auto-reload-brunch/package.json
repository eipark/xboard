  "readme": "## auto-reload-brunch\nAdds automatic browser reloading support to\n[brunch](http://brunch.io) when using the `brunch watch` command.\n\nThe plugin uses WebSocket technology to pass `compile` events to browser.\n\n## Installation\nInstall the plugin via npm with `npm install --save auto-reload-brunch`.\n\nOr, do manual install:\n\n* Add `\"auto-reload-brunch\": \"x.y.z\"` to `package.json` of your brunch app.\n  Pick a plugin version that corresponds to your minor (y) brunch version.\n* If you want to use git version of plugin, add\n`\"auto-reload-brunch\": \"git+ssh://git@github.com:brunch/auto-reload-brunch.git\"`.\n\n## Usage\nIn most cases, auto-reload-brunch works out of the box without any further\nconfiguration. Stylesheet changes will be applied seamlessly, and any other\nchanges will trigger a page refresh.\n\n### Brunch plugin settings\nIf customization is needed or desired, settings can be modified in your brunch\nconfig file (such as `brunch-config.coffee`):\n\n* __enabled__: _(Boolean or Object)_ Defaults to `true`\n    * As a boolean, turn on Auto-Reloading for any change in your project, or\n      off entirely.\n    * As an object, enable Auto-Reloading for specific types of changes. Keys\n      are the file extensions of compiled files (`js` or `css`) or `assets` to\n      cover any other watched files that do not get compiled. When an object is\n      used, only the types explicitly set to `true` will trigger an Auto-Reload.\n* __port__: _(Integer or Array of Integers)_ Defaults to `[9485..9495]`\n    * The port to run the WebSocket server on. It will be applied automatically\n      on the server and the client.\n    * If an array, it will use the first value, but automatically fail over to\n      the next value in the array if the attempted port is already in use on the\n      system. This allows multiple instances to run without conflict.\n* __delay__: _(Integer, in milliseconds)_ Optional, no default\n    * If your system is having race-condition type problems when the browser\n      tries to reload immediately after a compile, use this to set a delay\n      before the reload signal is sent.\n\n**Example:**\n```coffeescript\nexports.config =\n  ...\n  plugins:\n    autoReload:\n      enabled:\n        css: on\n        js: on\n        assets: off\n      port: [1234, 2345, 3456]\n      delay: 200 if require('os').platform() is 'win32'\n```\n\n### Client-side settings\nIf your `brunch watch` is running on a different machine than your\npreview screen, you can set `server` config variable to connect to a\nbrunch/websocket server running at another ip address.\n\n```html\n<script>\n  window.brunch = window.brunch || {};\n  window.brunch.server = '192.168.1.2';\n</script>\n```\n\nYou can also set the port (single integer only) and/or disable auto-reload\nvia client-side scripting, although generally it's a better idea to use\nbrunch config for this:\n\n```javascript\nwindow.brunch['auto-reload'].port = 1234\nwindow.brunch['auto-reload'].disabled = true;\n```\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2013 Paul Miller (http://paulmillr.com)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
