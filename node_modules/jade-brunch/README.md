## jade-brunch
Adds [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) support to [brunch](http://brunch.io), by 
compiling templates into dynamic javascript modules. If you also want the 
ability to compile into flat html files, check out the
[jaded-brunch](https://github.com/monokrome/jaded-brunch) plugin.

## Usage
Install the plugin via npm with `npm install --save jade-brunch`.

Or, do manual install:

* Add `"jade-brunch": "x.y.z"` to `package.json` of your brunch app.
  Pick a plugin version that corresponds to your minor (y) brunch version.
* If you want to use git version of plugin, add
`"jade-brunch": "git+ssh://git@github.com:brunch/jade-brunch.git"`.

## Assumptions

When using Jade's basedir relative `include` and `extend`, the basedir will be assumed to be 'app' within the Brunch root. See [#989](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade/pull/989)
